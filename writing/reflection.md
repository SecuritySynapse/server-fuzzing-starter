## Add Your Name Here

## Re-type the sentence "I adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code while completing this project."

TODO: You must retype the sentence here in order to digitally sign your pledge.

"I adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code while completing this project."

**IMPORTANT:** If you do not type the required sentence then the course
instructor will not know that you adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code
while completing the project.

## Program Output

### Report at least two examples of program output from when you run the `serverfuzzer` program

#### First output from running the `serverfuzzer` program

```text
output
```

#### Second output from running the `serverfuzzer` program

```text
output
```

## Source Code

### Explain, in detail, the defect in the `process_json` function

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the requested source code in `server.py`
TODO: Write at least one paragraph to explain the defect in the `process_json` function

### Explain in detail an automatically generated input that caused the `process_json` function to crash

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the requested JSON input that caused the crash
TODO: Make sure that the provided input is a valid JSON input that meets the format
TODO: Make sure that the provided input was automatically generated in GitHub Actions
TODO: Do not using an AI coding assistant to directly generate this JSON input
TODO: Do not provide a JSON input that arises from running the program on your laptop

### Describe in detail how the `serverfuzzer` program performs security fuzzing

TODO: Write at least one paragraph to explain how the `serverfuzzer` program performs security fuzzing

## Professional Development

### What is challenging about designing and using an automated input fuzzer for a server that processes JSON?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.
TODO: Make sure that your response specifically incorporates an aspect of this
project that is clearly evident in your source code and/or program output.
TODO: Make sure that your response provides low-level details and avoids high-level generalities.

### How do your experiences with this project suggest that you don't know the whole story about fuzzing?
